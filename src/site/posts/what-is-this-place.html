	This is mostly intended to be a place for me to describe and document
	the project that I occasionally do, although I&apos;m sure there will be posts about
	other things. There will (hopefully) be a rapid flurry of posts when this site
	first comes up as I have a whole host of older projects in need of documenting.</p><p>This site is a static website built using <a href="https://haunt.dthompson.us">Haunt</a>, a static site generator written in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile">Guile</a> scheme. There are a few reasons for my choice of such an odd and mostly unheard
	of framework. First, github pages
	are static sites by design so using a static site framework is
	the practical thing to do. Second, Guile is my favourite
	language to hack on so choosing a tool that let me build my site
	using Guile was a clear win. I also appreciate the minimalist nature
	of static web sites and there&apos;s a good chance that even without being
	restricted to a static site by the nature of github, I would still 
	choose to make a static site.</p><p>The site is organized into a few simple pages and a directory of posts.
	A full listing of the posts can be found on the Posts page. The Project
	page contains a list of all project related posts sorted by the project
	they&apos;re about. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, corrections, hate mail,
	or professions of undying affection, please direct them to my inbox at

Moreover, it can vary the amount that it rotates the colours based on fractal functions. Currently the Julia set and Mandelbrot fractals are supported. It shouldn&apos;t be too difficult to implement others. There&apos;s nothing particularly impressive about the program, but it was an interesting idea and if you fiddle with the inputs enough you can produce some relatively interesting outputs. With a bit of effort you can produce images that are significantly more pleasing than the one shown above. I believe there&apos;s also a much more limited python proof of concept in the repo as well.</p><p>Give it a try:</p><pre>git clone <a href="https://github.com/rbryan/crot">https://github.com/rbryan/crot

		the strangest desire to write my own programming language overcame me. This would be the
		first of many times I&apos;d feel this need. The idea first came to me while trying to figure
		out how to write programs for my HP-50G graphing calculator.</p><p>HP calculators have, for
		many years, been the only calculator to perpetuate a strange method of input. Rather than
		having the user input equations and expressions in the standard &quot;algebraic&quot; way that is
		common to most calculators, the user has the option of entering expressions in Reverse
		Polish Notation. For example, rather than entering: <code>1 + 2</code>to calculate a sum,
		the user might enter: <code>+ 1 2</code>This makes for a much more efficient, and, once you
		practice it for a while, natural feeling method of input.</p><p>Like most sufficiently fancy calculators, they also have a scripting language analagous
		to TI-BASIC on Texas Instruments calculators. Keeping consistency with their method of input,
		HP calculators use a language called RPL or Reverse Polish Lisp. I wanted to be able to
		develop and test RPL programs for my calculator on my computer, so I decided I was going
		to write my own interpreter. I quickly realized that this wouldn&apos;t be the easiest thing
		in the world to do because RPL consists entirely of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code">threaded</a> code with each function on the calculator being represented by a
		unique instruction. Because the code is stored and edited in this format I would have
		to write a custom editor or translator along with my compiler if I wanted it to be of 
		much use to me at all. In hindsight that doesn&apos;t sound so bad, but at the time it was a
		secondary goal. If I completed my language I knew I could translate it later.</p><h3>The Language</h3><p>This being my first experience with writing a programming language,
		I didn&apos;t want to have to futz about too much with writing my own
		parser so I used flex and bison to generate a parser and lexer for me. As it turns out,
		this ended up being almost as much work as writing the parser by hand. I&apos;m sure that
		they make the process of writing parsers much easier once you&apos;re experienced using them,
		but it wasn&apos;t the best choice at the time. In following projects I was more careful to
		consider the learning curve of the tools I used.</p><p>The language is threaded and stack based, much like RPL. There are two stacks. the
		user stack and the program stack. The user stack is where user data is pushed on entry.
		For example, suppose the user enters <code>2</code> the top value on the user stack will
		be the value <code>2</code>. The program stack is where program instructions are stored. When a token
		is lexed it is turned into an instruction and pushed to the program stack. The instruction
		at the base of the stack and works its way forward. Both of these stacks are stored in one
		large chunk of memory. The user stack is built up from the bottom and the instruction stack
		is built down from the top.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember the exact reason that I quit developing the language, but I seem to remember
		thinking that there were some, seemingly at the time, very difficult problems to face if I
		wanted to do more with the language. I&apos;m confident that with what I now know I could improve
		the language more, but at this point I&apos;ve moved on to other things. I think the next thing needed
		in the language would be user input and output functions. Now I don&apos;t think any of these would be too
		difficult, but I may have forgotten the reasons I didn&apos;t do them then.</p><h3>Example Program</h3><p>Here is an example program in rplisp to compute the factorial of 10.<pre>(	
	( &lt;&lt; 1 swap fact-work &gt;&gt; fact def )

	( &lt;&lt; 	
		&lt;&lt; dup 2 gt &gt;&gt;
		&lt;&lt; dup 1 - fact-work * &gt;&gt;
		&lt;&lt; * &gt;&gt;
		ifte
	&gt;&gt; 
	fact-work def )

	10 fact print 
)
</pre></p><p>Let&apos;s break this down. The first thing you need to know is that
		parentheses mean nothing. Chevrons (&lt;&lt;|&gt;&gt;), on the other hand, are
		a bit more important.<pre>&lt;&lt; 1 swap fact-work &gt;&gt; fact def</pre>The portion surrounded by chevrons is a snippet of code. Because
		It&apos;s in chevrons the whole bit of code is compiled and pushed to
		the stack as one instruction. <code>fact</code> is a symbol. Because it doesn&apos;t
		yet have a definition it&apos;s pushed to the stack. <code>def</code> is the define
		function. It associates the symbol fact with the code snippet previously
		pushed to the stack. So, now we have a fact function. In actuality it&apos;s
		a wrapper function for <code>fact-work</code>.<pre>&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; dup 2 gt &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; dup 1 - fact-work * &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; * &gt;&gt; ifte &gt;&gt;</pre>This is the meat of the factorial function. <code>ifte</code> is an
		if then else statement. It pops three code snippets from the stack.
		The last code snippet it pops is then run. If the top of the stack
		evaluates to true then it runs the second code snippet popped. Otherwise
		it will evaluate the third snippet popped. This code will duplicate
		the top value of the stack and compare it to <code>2</code>. If
		greater than two it will recursively call <code>fact-work</code>,
		otherwise, it will multiply one last time and leave the result on
		the stack.<pre>10 fact print</pre>Finally, we call <code>fact</code> on the value <code>10</code> and we print the result.</p><p>Give it a try:</p><pre>git clone <a href="https://github.com/rbryan/rplisp">https://github.com/rbryan/rplisp
